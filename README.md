# betteroffhand

Have you ever placed torches with your offhand while trying to place a block with your main hand? Do you think your offhand could be "smarter"? Well, this is what this mod improves. If the item you hold in your *main hand* can be right-click used on a block, then using your *offhand* on a block will be disabled. Items that can be right-click used on blocks include: blocks, doors, flint & steel, redstone, shovels, hoes, minecarts, leads and seeds. Uses that don't require a block to be targeted (e.g. throwing a snowball) will still be allowed.
